# E-Commercial-Database-Design-and-Implementation
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a fully functional, scalable, and integrity-driven E-commerce Database Management System (DBMS).
 Modern e-commerce platforms handle millions of customers, thousands of sellers, dynamic product listings, complex order flows, multi-stage shipment processes, real-time stock tracking, and multi-level refund and return mechanisms. Therefore, the goal of this project is to build a database that accurately models the operational requirements of an online marketplace while ensuring consistency, reliability, security, and efficient data retrieval.
